#welcome
welcome1: 'Welcome to the program for classifying meteor sounds'; 'Program has started'; 'I like that you started the program'
welcome2: 'If you hear this sound:';  "when you hear this sound"
welcome3: 'you can speak'; 'I expect you to say something';'you can say something'
welcome4: 'Would you like to get an introduction or would you like to do some practice?'; 'Do you want to learn the sounds with the introduction or with some practice?';'Would you like to hear the sound examples or do the pactice?'

#introduction
intro1: "Perfect. Now you'll get an introduction"; 'Lovely. You will now learn how to classify the sounds';'Great. We are now in the introduction part'
intro2: "There are 5 different types of meteors: Underdense meteor.., M meteor.., long overdense meteor, medium overdense meteor. And the short overdense meteor"; 'Meteors are classified into 5 different types, which are: Underdense meteor, M meteor, long overdense meteor, medium overdense meteor. And the short overdense meteor')
intro3: "The first sound is the underdense meteor"; "The underdense meteor sounds like this"
intro4: "The second sound is the short overdense meteor"; "The short overdense meteor sounds like this"
intro5: "The third sound is the M meteor"; "The M meteor sounds like this"
intro6: "The fourth sound is the medium overdense meteor";"The medium overdense meteor sounds like this"
intro7: "And the fifth sound is the long overdense meteor";"And the long overdense meteor sounds like this"
intro8: "Would you like to repeat, practice or continue to classify the sounds?"; "Did you get everything? What would you like to do now?"

#practice_level
practice1: "After you hear the sound, you can choose between the {} meteor, you should call this number {}... and the {} meteor, you should call this number {}."; "You have to coose between the {} meteor, which is number {}... and the {} meteor, which is number {}... After the sound, you should say a number."
practice2: "That was not a possible answer, try again"; "This answer is not possible, you can try again."
practice3: "I didn't understand, try it again.";
practice4: "Your answer is correct";"That is correct";"You gave the correct answer"
practice5: "Your answer was wrong. You chose {} meteor, which is number {}. That sound like this:..";"You chose the wrong answer. The {} meteor... number {} ... sounds like this:.."
practice6: "The correct answer was {} meteor, which is number {}. That sounds like this:..";"The meteor you were supposed to say is the {} meteor... number {}... and sounds like this:.."
practice7: "Try another time"; "Try it again"
practice8: "Let's continue";"Maybe we can do another level"
practice9: "After you hear the sound, you can choose between the {} meteor, you should call this number {}... the {} meteor, you should call this number {}... and the {} you should call this number {}."
practice10: "After you hear the sound, you can choose between the {} meteor, you should call this number {}... the {} meteor, you should call this number {}... the {} you should call this number {} and the {} you should call this {}."
practice11: "After you hear the sound, you can choose between all the meteors. You should call them 1,2,3,4 or 5"
practice12: "We are now in practice";"Now we are going to practice"
practice13: "There are 8 levels of practice.";"You have the option of 8 different levels."

#classification
class1: "We are going to classify some meteor sounds";"We are in the main part to classify some meteor sounds"
class2: "You can choose between the five meteors, and can also say it belongs to an other category or that you don't know the answer";"You can choose one of the five types of meteors... You can also say that you don't know the answer or that it belongs to an ... other ... category"
class3: "Are you ready?"; "Can we start?"
class4: "You chose number {} which is the {} meteor, is that correct?"; "Did you say number {}, which is the {} meteor?"; "Is it correct that you said number {}, the {} meteor?"
class5: "Here comes the sound"; "Now you will hear the sound" ; "Here is the sound"
class6: "Do you want to classify another sound?";"Would you like to hear another meteor sound?";"Shall we do an other one?"
class7: "You chose.. 'other'.., is it correct that you cannot classify it in the five categories?"; "You chose.. 'other' this means that you cannot classify it into one of the five categories, is that correct?"
class8: "You didn't know, therefore we give you another sound";"You can't know every sound, right? We give you another sound";"You didn't know the answer, therefore we give you another sound"
class9: "I didn't understand. I'm playing the sound again for you"; "My bad, I'm still learning, but I couldn't hear an answer I could use. We'll play the sound again";"Are you sure you said a number? I didn't understand so we play the sound again"
